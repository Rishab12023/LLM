      "1. **Soft Cheeses:**\n",
      "   - **Brie de Meaux**: A creamy, soft cheese with a bloomy rind, often considered one of the finest cheeses in the world.\n",
      "   - **Camembert de Normandie**: A soft, creamy cheese with a strong flavor, similar to Brie but typically stronger in taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Semi-Soft Cheeses:**\n",
      "   - **Morbier**: Known for its distinctive layer of ash in the middle, it has a fruity and slightly nutty flavor.\n",
      "   - **Reblochon**: A nutty and fruity cheese from the Alps, often used in the dish Tartiflette.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hard Cheeses:**\n",
      "   - **Comté**: A firm, nutty cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk, often compared to Gruyère.\n",
      "   - **Beaufort**: A firm, nutty, and slightly sweet cheese, similar to Comté but with its own unique character.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Blue Cheeses:**\n",
      "   - **Roquefort**: A tangy, salty blue cheese made from sheep's milk, known for its distinctive veins of blue mold.\n",
      "   - **Bleu d'Auvergne**: A creamy and strong blue cheese, similar to Roquefort but made from cow's milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Goat Cheeses:**\n",
      "   - **Chèvre**: French goat cheese comes in many forms, but they are often tangy, earthy, and sometimes coated in herbs or ash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these cheeses has its own unique characteristics, so the \"best\" one depends on your personal preferences. It's always fun to try a variety to see which ones you like the most!\n"
